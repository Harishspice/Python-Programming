# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
First, import math as m
### Step 2: 
Get the values of both the length of bridges
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![image](https://github.com/Harishspice/Python-Programming/assets/117935868/31459c44-ebf3-4f42-b76c-617d5ea4f34b)

### Step 4: 
Print the value with two decimal points 
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt((l2[0]-l1[0])**2+(l2[1]-l1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
```
